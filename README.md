# DEPRECATED: Since lavalink will be getting a plugin system soon this fork will not be updated anymore. However, I will turn it into a plugin to offer the same functionality.

# Lavalink
Standalone audio sending node based on Lavaplayer and JDA-Audio.
Allows for sending audio without it ever reaching any of your shards.

Being used in production by FredBoat, Dyno, LewdBot, and more.

A [very simple example bot](Testbot) is available.

## About this fork
This fork is a custom fork for DuncteBot that includes the following extra audio source managers:
- OC ReMix (ocremix.org)
- PornHub
- Reddit
- clyp.it
- getyarn.io
- TTS (Text To Speech, make sure that input starts with `speak:`)
- TikTok (experimental)

## Features
* Powered by Lavaplayer
* Minimal CPU/memory footprint
* Twitch/YouTube stream support
* Event system
* Seeking
* Volume control
* REST API for resolving lavaplayer tracks (used for non-JVM clients)
* Statistics (good for load balancing)
* Basic authentication
* Prometheus metrics
* Docker images

## Requirements

* Java 11* LTS or greater required.
* OpenJDK or Zulu running on Linux AMD64 is officially supported.

Support for Darwin (Mac), Windows AMD64, and Linux ARM (Raspberry Pi) is provided on a best-effort basis. This is dependent on Lavaplayer's native libraries.

Support for other JVMs is also best-effort. Periodic CPU utilization stats are prone to not work everywhere.

**\*Java 11 appears to have some issues with Discord's TLS 1.3. Java 14 has other undiagnosed HTTPS problems. Use Java 13. Docker images have been updated.** See [#258](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/issues/258), [#260](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink/issues/260)

## Versioning policy

The public api ("api" in a very broad sense) of Lavalink can be categorized into two main domains:
- **Client Domain:** The api exposed to clients, consisting of both the websocket protocol, and any public http endpoints
- **Server Domain:** The server application with its runtime environment, its configuration, etc.

Changes that might be breaking to one domain need not be breaking to the other.
Examples:
- Removing an endpoint. This is a breaking change for the client domain, but is
not a breaking change for running the server itself.
- Upgrading the minimum Java version: This is a breaking change for the server domain,
but client implementations couldn't care less about it.

Given the above, the following versioning pattern lends itself well to the Lavalink project:

_**api.major.minor.patch**_

- **Api**: Bumped when breaking changes are comitted to the client domain of Lavalink
Examples: Removing an endpoint, altering output of an endpoint in a non backwards compatible manner
- **Major**: Bumped when breaking changes are comitted to the Lavalink server domain
Examples: Bumping the required Java version, altering the configuration in a non backwards compatible manner
- **Minor**: New features in any domain
Examples: New optional endpoint or op code, additional configuration options, change of large subsystems or dependencies
- **Patch**: Bug fixes in any domain
Examples: Fixing a race condition, fixing unexpected exceptions, fixing output that is not according to specs, etc.

While major, minor and patch will do a best effort to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/),
prepending it with an additional api version makes life easier for developers of client implementations
in two ways: It is a clear way for the Lavalink project to communicate the actually relevant breaking changes
to client developers, and in turn, client developers can use the api version to clearly communicate to their
users about the compatibility of their clients to the Lavalink server.
